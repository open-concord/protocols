This is a compilation of all offically supported protocols.

These protocols interpret arbitrary data on the concord graph, and so are interchangable based on what you want to see.

These protocols are standalone, and so you must enter into their directory, and run the makefile to build them. The code included in this repository is a framework, your use case may demand some integration.

Currently, we have;
- HCLC
  - An exchange protocol between nodes
- CLAF
  - A 'default' chat server implementation
